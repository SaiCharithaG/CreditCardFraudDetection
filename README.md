# CreditCardFraudDetection

The aim of the study is to compare the performance of the unsupervised model with the supervised models in detecting fraudulent transactions and conclude the best technique in detecting frauds.

The research methodology includes important processes such as data selection, performing exploratory data analysis, implementing feature selection techniques, implementing supervised technique i.e., Random Forest and Logistic Regression, unsupervised technique i.e., Autoencoder. It also includes the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models.
